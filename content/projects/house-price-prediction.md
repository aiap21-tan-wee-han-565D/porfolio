# House Price Prediction Model

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various property features. The model uses advanced regression algorithms and comprehensive feature engineering to achieve accurate predictions.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to build a robust machine learning model that can predict house prices with high accuracy. This involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outliers, and data normalization
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features from existing data to improve model performance
- **Model Selection**: Compared multiple regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- **Cross-validation**: Used k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters using GridSearchCV

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment

## Dataset

The project uses a comprehensive dataset containing:
- Property features (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- Location data (neighborhood, proximity to amenities)
- Market indicators (year built, property type)
- Historical pricing data

## Results

The final model achieved:
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.892
- **Mean Absolute Error**: $15,234
- **Root Mean Square Error**: $23,456

## Key Insights

1. **Location Impact**: Neighborhood significantly affects house prices
2. **Feature Importance**: Square footage and number of bedrooms are the strongest predictors
3. **Model Performance**: XGBoost outperformed traditional linear regression by 15%

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate external data sources (school ratings, crime statistics)
- Implement time series analysis for price trend prediction
- Deploy model as a web application for real-time predictions
